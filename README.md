# SegwiseAssignment

### Requirements:
Python 3.11

### Instructions:

**Change File Location:** Replace any hardcoded file paths in the code with variables or functions that allow you to specify the location at runtime. This could involve using configuration files, environment variables, or Databricks secrets.

**Change Output Location:** Similar to file location, update any hardcoded output paths with dynamic options. Specify where you want the results (e.g., data frames, files) to be stored based on your configuration.

**Databricks Deployment:**
Ensure your cluster is running Python 3.11. You can configure this in the "Advanced Options" section of the cluster creation panel.

Upload the code files and libraries (if necessary) to your Databricks workspace.
Create a notebook or job to run the code. Remember to update the file and output paths to point to the locations within your workspace.

**Note:** This readme only provides general instructions. For specific details and adjustments to the code, please refer to the actual script.
